CBMF Final Project repository.

Attached are the 10x visium data sets under the Br tag.

There are three Jupyter notebooks. Most are self explanatory with content corresponding to filename. 

When running these a lot of dependencies were required; some of which have been cleaned up and others which have not. 
In addition some code modifications were done to especially for ELD to better run the code to our needs. These are not included in the repo but
have been commented. 

-PASTE2- is still a WIP with the last steps having been unfinished due to compute budget restraints. Once server access is obtained we will resume. 
-PASTE2- actually incorporates the clustering methods from SpaGCN instead of the proprietary ones from the original PASTE2 preprint. Further experimentation needed to determine cost/benefit between the two models.

-ELD2- Durring the first few cells of the ELD notebook we hosted some of the data on a discord server and code reflects that. The links for those may or may not still be up and functional but are equivalent to that of the attached slides in the repo. 
-ELD2- This most recent iteration shown in the notebook uses the 30 epochs in lieu of the reference 160*
